# Cats-vs-Dogs
## Project Overview

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using deep learning. Two different approaches are implemented:

1. **Training from Scratch:** A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to learn features from the data.
2. **Using VGG16:** The pre-trained VGG16 model is employed as a feature extractor for transfer learning.
